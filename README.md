Description: This is a fast-paced geographical guessing game that aims to help brand new Year 9 students at Howick College learn the school layout by viewing different areas through images. This game has been carefully crafted and designed to suit the end users (Year 9's) by employing replayability, instructions, engaging features such as a points and time system. Randomisation to ensure the user experiences a wide range of the school and strong validation with a broad acceptance of guesses to allow for a great user experience, and a fully functional game.

The aim of the game is to get through all 10 rounds as fast as possible while earning the most points you can.

The points system works accordingly: If the user guesses correctly on their first guess, they gain +3 points. If the user guesses correctly on their second guess, they gain +2 points. All other attempts reward +1 point only.

The time system works accordingly: +1 second per second as soon as the user submits their first guess. At the end of the game (round 10) the times are analysed and if applicable, will overwrite a leaderboard position which will be saved for future instances.

Requirements A non-mobile device. A python interpreter such as Python Idle Shell or Wing 101 to play the game. Download the zip file and ensure you open the game from its zip folder which it was downloaded in, do not move it out of this folder as it will break the game.
